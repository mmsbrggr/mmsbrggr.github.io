      For me, a stage is a bridge.
        It's where complex ideas from the world of research connect with the curiosity of a live audience.
        My passion is to build that bridge by <strong>translating cutting-edge science into engaging stories and clear, compelling insights</strong>.
        My goal is always the same: spark curiosity,
        and leave every person in the audience feeling informed and inspired.

  title: "My Expertise"
  description: >
    My work is built on three core pillars that connect deep research with real-world application.
  items:
    - title: AI & Formal Methods Research
      icon: "/assets/images/expertise/research.svg"
      description: >
        My academic foundation lies in the intersection of theoretical computer science, programming languages,
        dynamical systems and probability theory, with a focus on <strong>making software systems safe and reliable</strong>.
        I specialize in the automatic analysis of complex and probabilistic programs, using formal methods and
        a <strong>combination of symbolic and sub-symbolic AI</strong> to verify and analyze software behavior.
        I published mutliple peer-reviewed scientific papers and obtained my Ph.D. in 2025
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub_auspiciis_Praesidentis">Sub auspiciis Praesidentis</a>.

    - title: Software Engineering & Development
      icon: "/assets/images/expertise/coding.svg"
      description: >
        What has always captivated me about computer science is the power to build—to create useful
        tools and systems from the ground up. This passion is the common thread through my years of
        professional experience from <strong>full-stack web development</strong> in the core team of an open-source CMS, to building
        <strong>specialized analysis tools</strong> and plugins for various IDEs and programming languages.

    - title: Science Communication & Teaching
      icon: "/assets/images/expertise/speech.svg"
      description: >
        A core part of my mission is translating complex topics into clear, compelling narratives.
        I have delivered two TEDx talks on the broader impacts of AI, coached public speaking,
        and have experience organizing and teaching master-, bachelor- and Ph.D.-level university courses.
