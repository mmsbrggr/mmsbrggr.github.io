We process your personal data exclusively within the framework of the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018.

Note: For ease of reading, the term "data" is generally used, although personal data is meant. Statutory provisions without specification refer exclusively to those of the GDPR, unless otherwise stated.

In the following, we inform you in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR about the type, scope, and purpose of data collection and its use.

The controller responsible for data processing is:  

DI Dr.techn. Marcel Moosbrugger, BSc  
Frankenberggasse 8/4

## General Information on Data Processing

### Scope of Processing
As a matter of principle, we collect and use personal data of our users only to the extent necessary for the provision of a functional website as well as our content and services. The collection and use of our users' personal data regularly takes place only after the user has given their consent. An exception applies in cases where obtaining prior consent is not possible for factual reasons and the processing of the data is permitted by law.

### Legal Basis for the Processing of Personal Data
Insofar as we obtain your consent for processing operations of personal data, Art 6 (1) a serves as the legal basis.
When processing data that is necessary for the performance of a contract with you, Art 6 (1) b serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations that are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures.
Insofar as processing of data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, Art 6 (1) c serves as the legal basis.
If the processing is necessary to protect a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and if your interests and fundamental rights do not override the former interest, Art 6 (1) f serves as the legal basis.

### Data Deletion and Storage Period
Your data will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage ceases to apply. Storage may also take place if this has been provided for by European or national regulations, laws, or other provisions to which we are subject. The data will also be blocked or deleted if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless there is a necessity for the further storage of the data for the conclusion or fulfillment of a contract.

### Provision 
We use the web hosting service GitHub Pages for our website. The service provider is the American company GitHub Inc., 88 Colin P. Kelly Jr. St., San Francisco, CA 94107, USA.

GitHub also processes data from you in the USA, among other places. We would like to point out that, in the opinion of the European Court of Justice, there is currently no adequate level of protection for data transfers to the USA. This can be associated with various risks for the legality and security of data processing.

As a basis for data processing for recipients located in third countries (outside the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, i.e., especially in the USA) or a data transfer there, GitHub uses so-called Standard Contractual Clauses (= Art. 46. para. 2 and 3 GDPR). Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) are model templates provided by the EU Commission and are intended to ensure that your data also complies with European data protection standards when transferred to and stored in third countries (such as the USA). Through these clauses, GitHub undertakes to comply with the European level of data protection when processing your relevant data, even if the data is stored, processed, and managed in the USA. These clauses are based on an implementing decision of the EU Commission. You can find the decision and the corresponding standard contractual clauses here, among other places: [eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj). 

The GitHub Data Processing Agreement, which corresponds to the standard contractual clauses, can be found at [docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-data-protection-agreement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-data-protection-agreement).

You can learn more about the data processed through the use of GitHub in the Privacy Policy at [docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

## Use of Cookies
### Description and Scope of Data Processing
Our website uses cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in the internet browser or by the internet browser on the user's computer system. When a user calls up a website, a cookie can be stored on the user's operating system. This cookie contains a characteristic string of characters that enables the browser to be uniquely identified when the website is called up again.
We use cookies on our website that enable an analysis of the surfing behavior of our users. The following data can be transmitted: Entered search terms; Frequency of page views

The data of the users collected in this way is anonymized. Therefore, an assignment of the data to the calling user is not possible. The data is not stored together with other personal data of the users. When our website is called up, users are informed by an information banner about the use of cookies for analysis purposes. In this context, there is also a reference to how the storage of cookies can be prevented in the browser settings. The following cookies are used and are related to Google Universal Analytics: _gat; _gid; _ga

### Legal Basis for Data Processing
The legal basis for the processing of your data using technically necessary cookies is Art 6 (1) f. For cookies for analysis purposes, the legal basis is Art 6 (1) a if you have given your consent.

### Purpose of Data Processing
The purpose of using technically unnecessary cookies is to analyze the surfing behavior of users. All functions of our website can also be offered without the use of these cookies.

The use of analysis cookies is for the purpose of improving the quality of our website and its content. Through the analysis cookies, we learn how the website is used and can thus continuously optimize our offer. Our legitimate interest in processing your data in accordance with Art 6 (1) f also lies in these purposes.

### Duration of Storage, Possibility of Objection and Removal
Cookies are stored on the user's computer and transmitted from it to our site. Therefore, as a user, you also have full control over the use of cookies. By changing the settings in your internet browser, you can deactivate or restrict the transmission of cookies. Cookies that have already been saved can be deleted at any time. This can also be done automatically. There are several ways to manage cookies. The help button on the toolbars of most browsers will show you how to stop accepting cookies, how to be notified when a new cookie is set, and how to block cookies. If you block cookies, you may not be able to register, log in or use the services to their full extent.

The transmission of Flash cookies cannot be prevented via the browser settings, but by changing the settings of the Flash Player.

## Web Analysis and Optimization
On our website, we use the following services for web analysis and/or reach measurement.

### Google Analytics
We use Google Analytics from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. These analysis services create user profiles that are stored in text files (so-called "cookies") on your computer. This information is used to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity for us as the website operator, and to provide other services related to website and internet use. The use of Google Analytics also stores the IP addresses of the users. However, we use available IP masking procedures (pseudonymization by shortening the IP address) to protect users.

In general, no clear data of the users (such as e-mail addresses or names) are stored within the scope of the online marketing procedure, but pseudonyms. We as well as Google as the provider of the online marketing procedure do not know the actual identity of the users, but only the information stored in their profiles. The information in the profiles is usually stored in cookies or by means of similar procedures. These cookies can later generally also be read out on other websites that use the same online marketing procedure and analyzed for the purpose of displaying content, as well as supplemented with further data and stored on the server of the online marketing procedure provider.

In exceptional cases, clear data can be assigned to the profiles. This is the case if the users are, for example, members of a social network whose online marketing procedure we use and the network connects the user profiles with the aforementioned data. We ask you to note that users can make additional agreements with the providers, e.g. by giving their consent during registration.

In principle, we only receive access to summarized information about the success of our advertisements. However, within the framework of so-called conversion measurements, we can check which of our online marketing procedures have led to a so-called conversion, i.e., for example, to a contract conclusion with us. The conversion measurement is used solely to analyze the success of our marketing measures.

### Legal Basis for the Processing of Personal Data
The legal basis for the processing of users' personal data is Art 6 (1) lit f.

### Purpose of Data Processing
The processing of users' personal data enables us to analyze the surfing behavior of users, for example through reach measurement (e.g. access statistics, recognition of returning visitors), tracking (e.g. interest-/behavior-based profiling, use of cookies), visit action evaluation, profiling (creation of user profiles), click tracking, A/B tests, feedback (e.g. collecting feedback via online form), heatmaps (mouse movements on the part of users, which are summarized to form an overall picture), surveys and questionnaires (e.g. surveys with input options, multiple-choice questions). By evaluating the data obtained, we are able to compile information about the use of the individual components of our website. This helps us to constantly improve our website and its user-friendliness.

In addition to web analysis, we can also use test procedures to, for example, test and optimize different versions of our online offer or its components. For these purposes, so-called user profiles can be created and stored in a file (so-called "cookie") or similar procedures with the same purpose can be used. This information may include, for example, content viewed, websites visited and elements used there, and technical information such as the browser used, the computer system used, and information on usage times. If users have consented to the collection of their location data, this may also be processed, depending on the provider. The IP addresses of the users are also stored. However, we use an IP masking procedure (i.e., pseudonymization by shortening the IP address) to protect users. In general, no clear data of users (such as e-mail addresses or names) are stored in the context of web analysis, A/B testing and optimization, but pseudonyms. This means that neither we nor the providers of the software used know the actual identity of the users, but only the information stored in their profiles for the purposes of the respective procedures.

Our legitimate interest in processing the data in accordance with Art 6 (1) lit f also lies in these purposes. By pseudonymizing the IP address, the interest of the users in the protection of their personal data is sufficiently taken into account.

For the above-mentioned purposes, the following types of data are processed: Usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).

### Duration of Storage
The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for our recording purposes. The cookies set by the respective services have a "lifespan" of varying lengths. Some remain valid for up to 365 days, others only during the current visit. You can find out how to deactivate the cookies etc. in the section on the right to object and right to erasure.

### Possibility of Objection and Removal
We refer to the data protection notices of the respective providers and the possibilities of objection (so-called "opt-out") specified for the providers. If no explicit opt-out option has been specified, you have the option of deactivating cookies in your browser settings. However, this may restrict the functions of our online offer.

We therefore also recommend the following opt-out options, which are offered collectively for specific areas: a) Europe: [youronlinechoices.eu](https://www.youronlinechoices.eu). b) Cross-regional: [optout.aboutads.info](http://optout.aboutads.info)

## Rights of the User (Data Subject Rights)
If personal data relating to you is processed, you are a data subject within the meaning of the GDPR and you have the following rights against us as the controller:

### Right of Access
You can request confirmation from us as to whether personal data concerning you is being processed by us.

If such processing is taking place, you can request the following information from us:

The purposes and categories of personal data being processed, including the recipients or categories of recipients to whom your data has been or will be disclosed, as well as the planned duration of the storage of the data concerning you. Should we use profiling technologies, we must provide you with meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the scope and intended effects of such processing for you. Furthermore, we must inform you of your right to lodge a complaint with the data protection authority. You also have the right to request information as to whether the data concerning you is being transferred to a third country or to an international organization.


### Right to Rectification
You have a right to rectification and/or completion if your processed data is incorrect or incomplete. If applicable, we will make the correction without delay.

### Right to Restriction of Processing
Under the following conditions, you can request the restriction of the processing of your data:

1. if you contest the accuracy of the data concerning you for a period enabling us to verify the accuracy of your data;
2. the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your data and request the restriction of their use instead;
3. we no longer need your data for the purposes of the processing, but you require it for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, or
4. if you have objected to processing and it has not yet been determined whether our legitimate grounds override your grounds.

If the processing of your data has been restricted, this data may – with the exception of storage – only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person.

If the restriction of processing has been restricted in accordance with the above conditions, you will be informed by us before the restriction is lifted.

### Right to Erasure
We are obliged to delete your data without undue delay if one of the following reasons applies:

1. Your data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected by us;
2. You withdraw your consent and there is no other legal ground for the processing.
3. You object to the processing pursuant to Art 21 (1) and there are no overriding legitimate grounds on our part for the processing, or you object to the processing pursuant to Art 21 (2).
4. Your data has been unlawfully processed.

The right to erasure does not exist to the extent that processing is necessary

1. for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing (e.g. towards authorities and offices), or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest which has been assigned to us;
2. for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

### Right to Notification
If you have asserted the right to rectification, erasure or restriction of processing against us, we are obliged to notify all recipients to whom your data has been disclosed of this rectification or erasure of the data or restriction of processing, unless this proves impossible or involves a disproportionate effort.

You have the right to be informed about these recipients.

### Right to Object
You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to the processing of your data which is based on Art 6 (1) e or f; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions.

In this case, we will no longer process your data unless we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

If your data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of data concerning you for the purpose of such marketing; this also applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.

If you object to the processing for direct marketing purposes, the data concerning you will no longer be processed for these purposes.

### Right to Withdraw the Data Protection Consent Declaration
You have the right to withdraw your data protection consent declaration at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.


### Right to Lodge a Complaint with a Supervisory Authority
Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint pursuant to § 24ff DSG 2018 with the data protection authority if you consider that the processing of your data infringes the GDPR.

The data protection authority shall inform the complainant on the progress and the outcome of the complaint including the possibility of a judicial remedy.
